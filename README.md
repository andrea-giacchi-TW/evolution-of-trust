# THE EVOLUTION OF TRUST
During World War I, peace broke out.

It was Christmas 1914 on the Western Front.
Despite strict orders not to chillax with the enemy, British and German soldiers left their trenches, crossed No Man's Land, and gathered to bury their dead, exchange gifts, and play games.

Meanwhile: it's 2017, the West has been at peace for decades, and wow, we suck at trust.
Surveys show that, over the past forty years, fewer and fewer people say they trust each other.

So here's our puzzle:
- Why, even in peacetime, do friends become enemies?
- And why, even in wartime, do enemies become friends?

I think game theory can help explain our epidemic of distrust and how we can fix it!
So, to understand all this... let's play a game!

## Rules
You have one choice. In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine, the other player gets three coins – and vice versa. You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin).

- If you both cooperate you will get 2 coins each (-1 & +3).
- If you both cheat you will get 0 coins.
- If you cooperate and the other player cheat you lose 1 coin and the other player gets 3 coins, and vice versa.

Each game lasts between 3 and 7 rounds (you won't know in advance when the last round is).

## Players
Your opponents:
- COPYCAT: Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow
- ALWAYS CHEAT: the strong shall eat the weak
- ALWAYS COOPERATE: Let's be best friends!
- GRUDGER: I'll start **ALWAYS COOPERATE**, but if you all ever cheat me, I'll switch to **ALWAYS CHEAT** until the end.
- DETECTIVE: First: I analyze you. I start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate. If you cheat back, I'll act like **Copycat**. If you never cheat back, I'll act like **Always Cheat**, to exploit you. Elementary, my dear Watson.

#### More opponents
Mistakes, miscommunication, misinterpretations -- accidents happen all the time in real life. But if the other person doesn't think it was an accident... it will spiral into an endless cycle of vengeance, that started over a single mistake, long ago. Tragic!
So let's meet other types of players who can deal with mistakes:

- COPYKITTEN: Hello! I'm like **Copycat**, except I Cheat back only after you Cheat me twice in a row. After all, the first one could be a mistake! Purrrrr
- SIMPLETON: Hi I try start cooperate. if you cooperate back, I do same thing as last move, even if it mistake. if you cheat back, I do opposite thing as last move, even if it mistake.
- RANDOM: Monkey robot! Ninja pizza tacos! lol I'm so random (Just plays Cheat or Cooperate randomly with a 50/50 chance)

## Tournament
It's tournament time! Each character will now play against every other character.
Let's start with the 5 basic characters, that's 10 paired matches, and 10 rounds per match.
Who do you think will get the highest total score? Think carefully about it... and then PLACE YOUR BETS!

## Repeated Tournaments
Now, let's let our population of players evolve over time:
1. PLAY A TOURNAMENT: Let them all play against each other, and tally up their scores.
2. ELIMINATE LOSERS: Get rid of the 5 worst players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
3. REPRODUCE WINNERS: Clone the 5 best players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
4. REPEAT, for as long as you'd like. Note: you don't have to wait for people to literally die & reproduce for culture to evolve -- all that's needed is that "unsuccessful" behaviors go away, and "successful" behaviors are imitated.
